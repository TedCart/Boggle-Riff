<h1 style="color:black;"><u>{{sideLength}}x{{sideLength}} Rules:</u></h1>
<p id="word-length-reminder" style="text-align: left; font-size: 10pt;">Words must be at least {{minWordLength}} letters</p>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 10pt;">Words donâ€™t need to be in straight line!!  As long as each letter is touching the one that follows it (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) that word is fair game.</p>
